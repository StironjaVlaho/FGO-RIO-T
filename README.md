# Radar-Inertial Odometry with Online Temporal Offset Calibration (RIO-T) 

A factor graph-based loosely-coupled radar-inertial odometry that integrates online temporal calibration.

The implementation is based on our work **Impact of Temporal Delay on Radar-Inertial Odometry**, which is currently **under review.** 
The code will be made publicly available after the review process is complete.
